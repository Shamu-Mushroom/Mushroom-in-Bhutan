    <string name="magic_mushroom">Whatever it is – animal, vegetable or mineral – the fungus known scientifically as
        “Cordyceps Sinensis” and colloquially as yatsa gunbu, or “winter worm, summer grass”, has revolutionised the economy on the
        Tibetan plateau, where for about a decade now there’s been a crazy rush every summer to get up to the high altitude areas
        where it grows, dig out as many as possible and sell them for a small fortune into the Chinese medicine market.
        Although prices vary from year to year, they’re said to have increased by something like 900% since 1997, and top
        quality specimens can fetch up to $90,000 a kilo in the auction houses of Singapore and Hong Kong.</string>
